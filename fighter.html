        Fighters have mastered the art of combat, wielding weapons with unmatched skill and wearing armor like a second skin.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Fighter is the most versatile class in Baldur's Gate 3, allowing the player to use all martial weapons, simple weapons, and all armor types at level 1. Whether the player wants to specialize in ranged or melee combat, the fighter excels at both. However, one of the drawbacks to such a versatile class is that it is considered one of the weakest classes in the early game. Once the fighter reaches level 5 this is no longer the case, becoming a formidable class. By level 12, the fighter comes into its own as one of the strongest classes in a pure damage-per-turn discussion.
    </p>
    <p> 
        <br>
        The Fighter has three subclasses: <em>Battle Master</em>, <em>Eldritch Knight</em>, and <em>Champion</em>. Unfortunately, <em>Champion</em> is one of the worst subclasses in the game. The best subclass feature it provides (roll a 19 to crit instead of 20) is useful, but there are other methods to obtain this bonus as well as abilities in the game that guarantee crits. Both <em>Battle Master</em> and <em>Eldritch Knight</em> provide more damage, utility, and viability in a party composition. If you're inexperienced with how to build the fighter class, read on below about how to build the base fighter class before selecting a subclass.

        Level 1 Stat Distribution
        <br>	
    </h1>
    <p align="left">
        In every fighter build, strength should be prioritized with the +2 bonus. An important thing to note is that keeping even numbers for each stat is ideal for proficiency bonuses. This is difficult to do with the level 1 stat distribution, but players can always redo their stat distributions later in the game. Using Strength as an example, 16 Strength provides a +3 to Strength Checks and 18 Strength provides a +4 to Strength Checks. 17 Strength will still only provide a +3 bonus, so keep that in mind.
    </p>
    <p align="left"> The recommended stat distribution for a fighter at level 1 is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li align="left">Strength: 17</li>
        <li align="left">Dexterity: 14</li>
        <li align="left">Constitution: 14</li>
        <li align="left">Intelligence: 10</li>
        <li align="left">Wisdom: 12</li>
        <li align="left">Charisma: 8</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p align="left">
        Although it's not ideal to leave Strength at 17, there is a method early on in the beginning of the game that will allow the player to acquire +1 Strength to make it an even 18. By the end of the game, it is possible to acquire 24 Strength without elixirs and 27 with an elixir.

        Fighting Style
        <br>	
    </h1>
    <p align="left">
        Fighters are allowed to pick one fighting style at level 1. There are six fighting styles in total that cover all types of combat.

For example, if the player rolls a 1d4 fire damage roll and rolls a 1 or 2, it rerolls once. This effect also synergizes with <strong>Savage Attacker</strong>.</td>

        Illithid Powers
        <br>	
    </h1>
    
    <p align="left">Illithid powers are a unique power that the player can optionally choose to utilize. For the purposes of utilizing every powerup the game provides, builds will be built with Illithid powers in mind. However, all guides can still function without these powers. Below is a list of all illithid powers that synergize efficiently with the fighter class and all of its subclasses: </p>	
    
    <img src="images/illithidpowers.png" alt="Illithid Powers" id="illithid-image">
    
    <p align="left"><strong>Favourable Beginnings: </strong>This passive isn't significantly powerful, but it can be used for both dialogue and combat purposes. You primarily take this to unlock tier two illithid powers.</p>
    
    <p align="left"><strong>Luck of the Far Realms: </strong>This is one of the most powerful illithid powers simply because every class can utilize it. One free crit per long rest is very useful for setting up combos (i.e., on-crit effects) and choosing when to burst a target.</p>
    
    <p align="left"><strong>Perilous Stakes: </strong>One of the most underrated illithid powers in the game due to its healing nature. It is one of the most efficient ways in the game to apply Vulnerability (double damage) to an enemy, especially since it applies Vulnerability for all damage types (magic, physical).</p>
    
    <p align="left"><strong>Mind Sanctuary (Available in Act 3): </strong>This illithid power along with Perilous Stakes are core abilities for most martial class builds. As a fighter, actions are more valuable than bonus actions due to the "extra attack" passive. With Mind Sanctuary, the amount of attacks a Fighter can achieve in one turn significantly increases. </p>

        Permanent Buffs

    <p align="left">Throughout the game there are instances where one character or an entire party can receive permanent buffs. The ideal buffs for the fighter class are listed below:<br></p>

    <div id="container2">
        <p align="left" style="font-size: 22pt"><strong>Act 1</strong></p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> Auntie Ethel's Hair:</strong> Easily missable. Requires the player to get Auntie Ethel to 10% health in her lair. Provides a +1 to any Ability Score. This can be used to reach an even 18 without a feat.</p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> Volo's Ersatz Eye:</strong> Replaces one eye with a magical alternative that provides a permanent "See Invisibility" effect, allowing the one character to see invisible creatures within 9 meters. 
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> Awakened:</strong> Allows the use of Illithid powers as a bonus action instead of an action. Useful since actions are more valuable for a fighter than bonus actions.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> BOOOAL's Benediction:</strong> This buff provides advantage on attack rolls against bleeding targets. This buff requires the player to sacrifice one companion (no hirelings), but the buff is applied to all party members.
        </p>	
        <p align="left" style="font-size: 22pt"><strong>Act 2</strong></p>
        <p align="left">

        <p align="left">
            <strong> Bless:</strong> Provides one character with a permanent bless at all times (+1d4 bonus on attack rolls and saving throws). This is the most expensive permanent buff (5000 gold).
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> Tharchiate Coxex Blessing:</strong> Gives one character +20 temporary hit points per long rest. This is very useful to have before going into a boss fight.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <strong> Mirror of Loss:</strong> Gives a character +2 ability score of their choosing in exchange for -2 from another ability score. However, the -2 can be decursed resulting in a free +2 to any stat.
